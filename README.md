# MyContactsSampleApp

This is a sample APP, to test and practice my skills. 

This app consists on merging together the contacts from the user's device with a list of Rick and Morty Characters from the https://rickandmortyapi.com API. Contacts are saved locally in a database and showed in a list in an alphabetical order.

**In this sample app you will find the following implementations:**
 * Dependecy injection using Koin library
 * MVVM architecture
 * API requests using Retrofit2 and a fake local API services
 * Coroutines for background data management
 * Reactive code using LiveData and Transformations
 * RecyclerView and adapter with filter, pagination and SwipeRefresh
 * Image loading using Glide library
 * Room library for persistence data
 * Data binding
 * Some unit test using MockK (Mockito)
